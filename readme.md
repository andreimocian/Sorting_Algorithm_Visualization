# Sorting algorithms visualization in SFML

This is a sorting algorithms visualizer made in `C++` with the `SFML` library.

## Algorithms
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort

## How to build
This project was built using `MSVC` and `CMake`. The `CMake` file will automatically fetch the latest `SFML` library used by the project.

##	How to use
After the program is started, the user interface will appear.

### Controls
- `Left and right arrow keys` to scroll through the algorithms
- `Enter` to select the algorithm
- `Space` to start the visualization
- `Escape` to go back to the main menu
